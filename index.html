                    You awaken groggily, and find yourself laying on a sandy beach. You realize you are bleeding from your head, but have no idea why, or where you are.
                    The last thing you remember was...was...you have no idea. Your mind is blank.
                </p>

                <p>You slowly climb to your feet, the ominous words still ringing in your ears. The sun is hot and beating down, it makes you feel dizzy.</p>
                <p>
                    As you look around you see a dark cave to the north, it looks cool, but very dark and uninviting. To the west the beach continues banked on one side by
                    thick jungle, and on the other by the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>The way to the east is covered with jagged rocks, but you think you can pick your way through them. To the south is endless ocean. </p>

                <p>You walk northward, toward the dark cave. The cool air rolls out to greet you, it feels so nice on your sun baked skin. It is dark inside, far too dark to see. If you put your hand to the wall, and walk slowly, you think you might make it though.</p>
                <p>From somewhere deep in the cave, you hear a deep but almost inaudible growl...it must be the wind.</p>

                    You are back where you woke up. The blood from your head still stains the sand, though the waves hitting the shore slowly claim it. As you look around you see a dark cave to the north, it looks cool, but very dark and uninviting. To the west the beach continues banked on one side by
                    thick jungle, and on the other by the ocean.

                <p>Suddenly, you notice something shiny rolling back and forth in the waves, there is no way to tell for sure from here. The way to it is treacherous, the waves crash into the rocks, making them slippery. </p>
                <p>There is a stick laying to your right. Maybe you could use it to pull the object toward you.</p>

                <p>You begin to walk down the beach, the sun continues to beat down on you. Sweat pours down your face, and your head throbs. You realize you wont last long out here. You need to get to cover before heat stroke takes over.</p>
                <p>To the left, is a thick, lush jungle. The canopy offers shade, and you may even be able to find water, but you also know jungles can be dangerous.</p>
                <p>To the right is the ocean, endless water. Maybe a swim would help cool you?</p>

                <p> You decide the ocean looks too inviting to pass up. You wade into the warm water, and sit down, letting the waves crash on your face. It feels great. You notice however, the water around you...looks red. The blood from your head is washing off into the water. At that moment, you see the fin coming toward you, your blood is bringing in a shark! You scramble to shore just in time. </p>

                <p> You put your hand to the wall, it is so cold you pause a moment to enjoy it. Then, screwing up your courage, you take for first steps into the inky black. The cave is beyond dark. But it is cool and refreshing, it invigorates you. You keep one hand on the wall, and the other ahead of you as you move through the cave.</p>
                <p> Again, you hear the deep, low growl. "It's just the wind..." You keep telling yourself over and over again..."It's just the wind..." But part of you knows, it isn't.</p>
                <p> Suddenly, your hand looses the wall, the finds it again. You realize there is a turn here to the right.</p>

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p> As you continue down the cave, ahead you see light in the distance. You keep moving toward it, with new hope that you may actually escape this place. The light grows brighter, and brighter until you jump out of the cave and are blinded by the light. As your eyes adjust, you see the best thing you have ever seen ahead. A boat, anchored just off shore. You scream to them, and they look back, confused.</p>
                <p> Without hesitation you dive into the water and swim to the boat. They help you on board and you tell them your tale. The funny thing is, you still have no idea who you are or where you are going. But at least you are off that terrible island.</p>
                <br />
                <p> Congratulations! You survived the island!</p>

The growl turns into a roar, and something huge jumps onto you, in the ark you struggle against your attacker, but you have no chance. It crushes your skull with one bite. </p>
